# SlimeRPG
This is a prototype RPG game. 

Made on Unity 2021.3.19f1. 

Blue capsule - our slime moves forward on the platform, opponents are coming to it, red cubes - they have health.
Slime shoots them with a sphere. The sphere flies in an arc.
By killing opponents, slime gets soft currency.

On the software, you can pump the basic parameters of the slime:
1. The value of the attack
2. Attack speed

Slime has a life parameter that can also be pumped
Opponents approaching slime begin to attack him.
There is a HP bar over the head of slime and opponents
There are also outgoing values for how many lives this or that attack took.
